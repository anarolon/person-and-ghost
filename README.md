## What is Person & Ghost?
Person & Ghost is a two-dimensional, story-driven, cooperative puzzle game in which two players are confined in a castle and must go down its floors while overcoming hazards and obstacles to reach its main entrance and escape. The game’s narrative will revolve around Person’s journey to bring Ghost, their once best friend, back to life. Person & Ghost will be a software product for audiences interested in co-op puzzle games with narrative exploring realistic personal and interpersonal topics such as grief, friendship, cooperation, reconciliation, and forgiveness. 

## Motivations
The inception of this indie game project was heavily influenced by our passion for video games and their development. We decided to nurture and bring this idea to life as our capstone project since we wanted to create a product that leveraged our experience as software engineers, our creativity, and our knowledge of Unity’s Real-Time Development Platform. 

## Goals
Our main goal is create a user-friendly cooperative video game which delivers an overall experience that friends will be able to not only enjoy together, but also bond over. Our secondary goal, whose successful completion is derived from that of our main goal, is to create a product capable of inspiring aspiring and established game developers in Puerto Rico, thus contributing to the growth of the local game development industry and its market.
